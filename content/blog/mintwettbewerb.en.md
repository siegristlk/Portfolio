      It's a great project that makes my heart beat faster! As part of a two-day STEM competition, we created an immersive learning environment in which students were challenged with realistic scenarios, such as earthquake missions and rainforest research. The young people faced exciting tasks. On the first day, they had to transport water as far as possible in the context of an earthquake. On the second day, they had to carry water to great heights to supply researchers in tree shelters. </p><p>These authentic contexts helped them activate existing knowledge, take on new roles, and develop creative solutions independently. Their commitment to the design thinking process was particularly impressive. From brainstorming to building prototypes to continuous improvement. When learning is practical and meaningful, it leaves a lasting impression. </p><p>The celebratory closing event took place last week. Together with teachers, families, and young people, we admired the creative projects at an exhibition. I am grateful to have been involved in this project in various roles, from developing tasks to organizing and moderating the closing event.</p><p>Another highlight was not only organising this event, but also writing an <a href="/img/blog/zeitung_mintwettbewerb.png" target="_blank">articel</a> about the event for the Fricktaler Zeitung. </p><p>Thank you, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marie-pachtovÃ¡-leiterin-schullabor/" target="_blank">Marie PachtovÃ¡</a>, for giving me the opportunity to take part in this inspiring project at the <a href="https://basel.lehre.roche.com/experio/" target="_blank">Schoollab Experio</a>!
