### 1st job: Working Student

During my time as a working student at ZF Friedrichshafen, I was involved in production line work, assembling automotive transmissions as part of a large-scale manufacturing process. This hands-on experience gave me valuable insight into the dynamics, routines, and demands of industrial environments. It shaped my understanding of what it means to work in structured, process-driven settings – and deepened my awareness of how learning and communication need to be tailored to meet the needs of people in such contexts.
