### Exploring learner needs - deepening educational research experience

AAs a Research Assistant in the Technology-Enhanced Learning Lab led by Professor Tomohiro Nagashima at Saarland University, I supported a qualitative research project aimed at understanding how students, teachers and other stakeholders perceive and prefer using AI tools in the classroom. A core part of my work involved planning and conducting semi-structured interviews with teachers, as well as analysing and interpreting the resulting qualitative data. I also worked with storyboards to create realistic user scenarios to guide our interview design and data interpretation. Through this experience I deepened my skills in user-centred research, especially in identifying educational needs, comparing perspectives and translating findings into design-relevant conclusions for digital learning systems.
