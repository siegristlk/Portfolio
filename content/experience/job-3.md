### Designing hands-on STEM experiences that turn complexity into curiosity

At F. Hoffmann-La Roche's School Lab Experio, I help design and deliver hands-on STEM workshops that bring scientific concepts to life for students. My role involves not only running sessions in the lab, but also helping to develop new teaching formats and digital learning experiences. I adapt our offerings to meet the different needs of each class - some benefit from structured guidance, while others thrive with more autonomy and space to explore. This experience has deepened my understanding of how learning environments can be both creative and functional, and how didactic clarity and flexibility can go hand in hand. It has also sharpened my skills in translating complex content into engaging, age-appropriate learning formats - both analogue and digital.
