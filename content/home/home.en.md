    subtitle="Instructional designer with a focus on digital learning"
    description="<br/>My name is Lisa, and I work at the <a target='_blank' href='https://basel.lehre.roche.com/experio/'>School Lab Experio </a> of Hoffmann-La Roche in Basel 🇨🇭, where I design and facilitate practical STEM workshops. <br/>My goal is to make learning tangible, relevant and sustainable. Thanks to my interdisciplinary background, I consider educational spaces from the perspectives of learners, teachers and the organisation as a whole. My projects combine technology, didactics and practice, whether it's digital museums, interactive learning formats or AI in the classroom. I work in a reflective, empathetic and collaborative way, with the aim of designing educational experiences that empower, connect and open up new opportunities."

    title="Who am I?"
    content="<br/>My professional journey has taken me from social and organisational pedagogy to educational technology, combining pedagogical thinking with digital expertise and user-centred research. I work at the intersection of learners, teachers, and technology, translating complex requirements into practical, well-considered solutions empathetically and based on evidence, while keeping an eye on the big picture. <br/>Rather than viewing didactics as a rigid concept, I see it as a design task closely linked to design processes that provide learners with orientation and freedom simultaneously."
