    subtitle="Digital Learning Developer & Instructional Designer"
    description="Based in Basel ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­, I currently work at the Experio School Lab of F. Hoffmann-La Roche, where I design and run practical STEM workshops, develop new educational programmes and work at the interface between raising interest and didactically conveying learning content. I am driven by the idea of making learning tangible, relevant and sustainable.<br/>My background combines Social and Organisational Pedagogy with a Masters in Educational Technology - a combination that allows me to think about educational spaces holistically: from the perspective of the learner, the instructor and the organisation. Whether digital museums, interactive learning units or research into the role of AI in the classroom, my projects operate at the intersection of technology, pedagogy, didactics and practice.<br/>With a flair for people, an eye for detail and a love of research, I bring interdisciplinary thinking to every project.<br/>What always comes first: <strong>Education should empower, connect and create opportunities</strong>."

{{< about-section
    title="Who am I?"
    content="As a learning designer with a curious mind and a feel for the bigger picture, I combine pedagogical insight with a passion for digital design. My Bachelor's degree in Social and Organisational Education gave me a deep understanding of how people learn â€“ not just as individuals, but within social and organisational contexts. During my Masterâ€™s in Educational Technology, I expanded on this foundation, exploring digital tools and user-centred research to design learning that is both effective and meaningful.<br/>I enjoy working at the intersection of learners, educators and technology. Using methods like interviews and storyboards, I dive deep into understanding needs â€“ and turn insights into concrete, practical solutions. What shapes my approach to digital learning is not only my academic background, but also my sense for when structure supports learning and when freedom enables it. I think in systems, design with empathy, and develop learning experiences that not only function â€“ but feel purposeful, engaging, and right for those involved."
