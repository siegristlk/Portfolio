The topic of Open Educational Resources (OER) was presented in the form of a digital museum, but in a way that was deliberately different from traditional exhibitions. We've all experienced it: endless walls of text and overloaded panels, which quickly lose the interest of visitors and have little educational value.

This is precisely where this museum comes in: not only is it digital and therefore much more accessible, it is also interactive. Visitors can get involved, make assessments, guess and discover things for themselves. This creates a learning experience that arouses curiosity, engages the visitor and leaves a lasting impression.
