Tea is one of the world's most popular drinks, enjoyed for its pleasure and as a ritual of mindfulness. However, preparing tea correctly requires precision; temperature, brewing time, and quantity significantly impact taste and effect. To simplify this process, we developed ITea, a smart assistant that helps you brew the perfect cup of tea every time.

Using an NFC card, the device recognizes the type of tea and provides clear instructions, automatically starting the appropriate timer. As soon as the tea is ready to drink, it signals you â€” without the need for additional aids or the hygiene issues associated with fully automatic machines. This keeps the preparation process simple, personalized, and under your control.

The project was developed as part of the computer science course "Interactive Systems" and combines user-centered design with technical implementation.
