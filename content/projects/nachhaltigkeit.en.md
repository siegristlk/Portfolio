## The content is used for the description of the project

Achieving sustainability on campus can be challenging, especially for international students who are often unfamiliar with the German waste separation system. A user study revealed that they are not well-versed in the subject and that existing information is typically only available in German, making it difficult to access.
Saarland University aims to promote sustainable behavior among students and employees. As a research and innovation hub, the university has a particular social responsibility.
Therefore, an interactive prototype was developed based on the existing campus app, which is known for its canteen plan, among other features. This new prototype integrates sustainability content. Implemented with Figma, it shows how tips on recycling or bicycle use can be integrated in an easily accessible, user-friendly way.
