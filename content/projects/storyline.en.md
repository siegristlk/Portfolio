This learning unit, developed as part of a group project, introduces learners to the replication crisis in empirical research through interactive content. It demonstrates why replicability is essential to the validity of scientific results and how research decisions can affect their quality.

Based on Gagné's “Nine Events of Instruction” and Schank's “Goal-Based Scenario,” the didactic design uses structured learning scenarios with knowledge transfer, practice phases, and feedback to create an interactive, practice-oriented learning environment. The unit was developed with Articulate Storyline 360 to provide an engaging, accessible learning experience.

It helps learners recognize problematic research practices and apply principles such as transparency and replicability to their work. The unit is intended for beginners and experienced researchers alike and can be adapted to different levels of prior knowledge.
