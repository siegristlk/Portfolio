      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;designing-hands-on-stem-experiences-that-turn-complexity-into-curiosity&#34;&gt;Designing hands-on STEM experiences that turn complexity into curiosity&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;At Hoffmann-La Roche&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;School Lab Experio&lt;/em&gt;, I work on designing and implementing hands-on STEM workshops that bring scientific concepts to life for students. My role involves not only running sessions in the lab, but also helping to develop new teaching formats and digital learning experiences. I adapt our offerings to meet the different needs of each class - some benefit from structured guidance, while others thrive with more autonomy and space to explore. This experience has deepened my understanding of how learning environments can be both creative and functional, and how didactic clarity and flexibility can go hand in hand. It has also sharpened my skills in translating complex content into engaging, age-appropriate learning formats - both analogue and digital.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;exploring-learner-needs---deepening-educational-research-experience&#34;&gt;Exploring learner needs - deepening educational research experience&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a Research Assistant in the &lt;em&gt;Technology-Enhanced Learning Lab&lt;/em&gt; led by Professor Tomohiro Nagashima at Saarland University, I supported a qualitative research project aimed at understanding how students, teachers and other stakeholders perceive and prefer using AI tools in the classroom. A core part of my work involved planning and conducting semi-structured interviews with teachers, as well as analysing and interpreting the resulting qualitative data. I also worked with storyboards to create realistic user scenarios to guide our interview design and data interpretation. Through this experience I deepened my skills in user-centred research, especially in identifying educational needs, comparing perspectives and translating findings into design-relevant conclusions for digital learning systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;first-experiences-in-industrial-work-environments&#34;&gt;First experiences in industrial work environments&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;During my time as a working student at ZF Friedrichshafen, I was involved in production line work, assembling automotive transmissions as part of a large-scale manufacturing process. This hands-on experience gave me valuable insight into the dynamics, routines, and demands of industrial environments. It shaped my understanding of what it means to work in structured, process-driven settings â€“ and deepened my awareness of how learning and communication need to be tailored to meet the needs of people in such contexts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
